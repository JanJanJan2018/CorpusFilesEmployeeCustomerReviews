At Massage Heights it has such a family vibe amongst co workers. everyone does their part and helps one another out with out being asked. Management is very acommodating in time of need.

Was a very relaxing place to work in.

Fun and competitive place to work. Your compensation is limited only by you - salary plus commission. Massages and Facials included as a perk - can't beat that. :-)
Pros
services, great management and clients
Cons
no insurance. 7 days a week

Massage Heights
Massage Therapist (Former Employee) –  Johnston, IA – December 14, 2017
I worked at Massage Heights in Johnston, Iowa. It was an excellent work experience at the time. The tables were all hydraulic, which was a plus. The add on services were simple, but effective. It was an all around great place to work. I would recommend.
Pros
Supportive Staff
Cons
Back to Back Massages With Little Breathing Room
