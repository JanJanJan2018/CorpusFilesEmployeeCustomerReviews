terrible company
Regional Manager (Former Employee) –  Tempe, AZ – July 31, 2018
terrible pay. terrible work life balance. terrible management. terrible advancement. terrible job security. This is coming from someone that was at the top of the organization.

Toxic workplace
Personal Trainer (Former Employee) –  Sandy Springs, GA – July 27, 2018
I thoroughly enjoyed training my clients. The issue was I was paid less than 20% of what the client paid for the session. The only way to earn a decent paycheck was spend essentially all day in the gym. That disconnect is unacceptable. Luckily I had a good manager who helped me boost my clientele in addition to my solid training ability.
Pros
Free membership
Cons
Low pay, no paid time off
terrible experience

Pros
flexible breaks
Cons

They will lie to you
Personal Trainer (Former Employee) –  Highland Village, TX – July 23, 2018
DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING ANYONE HERE EVER TELLS YOU. They will promise you a promotion from day one and you will never receive it. Clients paid $140 an hour for me and I was compensated $12 an hour!!!!! Employees either don't know what's going on or don't care. Management is abysmal. Sales people are unethical and lie to everyone, and as a qualified and educated trainer it is then up to you to inform the client how much of what they were told is false. LA Fitness also covers their own corporate drones. The culture is such that if you contact human resources, any complaint bounces back and is shown to your boss. When I tried to contact human resources over being lied to and manipulated, it resulted in a hostile workplace. My boss enticed many of my clients with upgrades and when I lost clients, I lost hours and was fired.
Pros
Make your own schedule
Cons
Lies, falsehoods, manipulation, no ethics, No money
Awful
Assistant Manager (Current Employee) –  Beaverton, OR – July 22, 2018
Pay was awful, long hours with no benefit. 
Management only cares about themselves. Steals commission. 
Many days of just sitting at the desk with no much to do.
Cons
Everything
Very Unhappy
Sales Counselor (Former Employee) –  32nd Street and Bell – July 21, 2018
I was not happy here. The area manager was more concerned about the sale than the well being of the consumer. I had an extremely difficult time morally working for the company. I was, at one point, in the middle of a sale when somebody started convulsing in the steam room so I got up to go help the gentleman in the steam room who needed assistance and was told, "Never leave the money on the table in a sale". The company is more concerned about money than the happiness of the employees and the safety of the members.
Pros
Excellent Benefits
Cons
No Sense of Morality
LA Fitness
Master trainer (Former Employee) –  Florida – July 16, 2018
Solid pay when you build your client base, management can be hit or miss. In 5 years I probably saw hundreds of employees, very high turnover rate .
Pros
Free membership
Cons
No PTO, no vacation
Don’t work here
Front Desk Receptionist (Former Employee) –  Mission Viejo, CA 92691 – July 12, 2018
If this isn’t your dream career, don’t work here. It’s nothing but calling to clear up memberships that came back unpaid. If you don’t get it cleared up you get in trouble. If you try your best but still don’t get it, you get threatened. Still continue to try but nothing happens? Thanks for coming but it’s best we part ways. Unrealistic expectations for a receptionist.
Pros
Free membership
Cons
Management, clear ups
Training Director was terrible
Personal Trainer (Former Employee) –  Atlantic Beach, FL – July 9, 2018
The Personal Training director at our location in Atlantic Beach, Florida knew about as much about training clients as a chimpanzee knows about using a typewriter. The work environment was always stressful due to the fact that none of the trainers enjoyed their jobs at all. There was not one person who liked coming to work at this location.
Pros
Free gym membership
Cons
Everything there other than the free membership
Managers Have No Awareness of Member Needs and Disrespect Employees
REGIONAL AEROBIC COORDINATOR / ACTIVITIES DIRECTOR (Former Employee) –  Louisville, KY – July 3, 2018
Management took on the Midwest with no clue of the culture and needs of clients. They don't want a cookie cutter group fitness program where the schedule is exactly the same across the country and not based in local school schedules, needs, etc. Corporate management wanted me to push people into roles for which they were inexperienced and would've provided a terrible customer experience such as teaching class formats in which they were untrained. Management does not want employees networking with one another, creating a sense of community among employees. Atmosphere was not conducive to being a team and working with one another to provide the best customer service and gym experience possible.
