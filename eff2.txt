Once upon a time...
Systems Engineer (Current Employee) –  Denver, CO – July 31, 2018
Chipotle was the best place to work. We worked hard for ideals - do the right thing for the customer, the worker, the farmer, the animals, and the shareholder, too.
Pros
monthly food stipend
Cons
activist investor takeover
Chipotle- Its a Mans World
Area Manager (Current Employee) –  Pennsylvania – July 26, 2018
The job itself is easy for an experienced multi-unit leader with any retail background. The culture is so pervasively male that it is hard to navigate even if you have existed in a male dominated culture successfully before. The company is tragically unorganized. The leadership at the Director level and above are consistently unqualified and not trained or aware of standardized business practices and often general legal business basics.
Pros
Flexible Work Schedule
Cons
Unorganized
fast-paced environment
Full-time Hourly Team Member (Former Employee) –  San Jose, CA – July 25, 2018
Proper training should be provided for new employees and new managers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with either mornings or night shifts unfinished tasks. Also dealing with rude customers or the homeless coming into the store interrupting customers in the lobby. Another thing that was also difficult is working in the store that provides catering and has a low staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to work with people that like to get the job done and be stress free. When you get to work with those who like working in a fast pace your entire shift is awesome. It goes smooth and all you really get to worry about is providing great customer service.
Pros
one free lunch
Cons
short breaks
The One In Annapolis Mall
Assembly Line Worker (Former Employee) –  Annapolis, MD – July 25, 2018
None of this is bias. They work you like a slave. I was personally an assembly liner, but they had me doing food prep, dishes, cleaning, AND EVEN TRASH, all for minimum wage. If it’s not as busy as they thought it’d be, they cut your hours back, so if you’re part time, you’ll be working less than 20 hours a week, on minimum wage, which means now you’re making way less than the standard to live. The management is horrible, you can ask the cookers to make something but they’ll be so busy in a conversation it won’t be done. It’s HOT and humid behind that assembly line and there’s like no AC sometimes. Your gloves and fingers are constantly being burned from the tortilla cooker, and you have to go through all this with a smile because if the manager sees you not smiling they talk about you (they did it in my case, one of my coworkers came and told me) and then you don’t even get a free bowl to take home at night after all of that.
Pros
Coworkers Might Be nice
Cons
short breaks, hot temps, inconsiderate managers, etc.
Easy job
