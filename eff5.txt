Fun and productive workplace with many advancements
Full-time Certified Trainer (Current Employee) –  Pittsburgh, PA – February 24, 2018
I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. 

I appreciate the fact that management sees potential in me to grant me opportunities to train others, as well as climb the ladder of the many advancements that Chipotle grants their workers. 

I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with this corporation, because they have molded me into a worker who looks out for other coworkers, and the people who she serves.

Crew Member (Former Employee) –  Moore, OK – July 26, 2018
I loved working with chipotle. It was the cleanest place i’ve seen and ran very smoothly until the end. My location was in the middle of switching managers and they didn’t schedule me for 3 weeks. When i questioned it she said she “assumed i was fired” and her assumption left me with no paycheck 2 weeks before christmas.
Pros
free meal, team environment, like a family
