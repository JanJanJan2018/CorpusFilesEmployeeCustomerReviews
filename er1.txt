No growth, lazy management
Human Resources Team Member (Part-Time) (Former Employee) –  San Diego, CA – February 6, 2018
The people were great, management was really bad though. Mgmt was lazy and really didn't care. No full-time positions, and the pay was minimum wage even with experience

ugh

you get 10% off your purchase as a discount. pretty cool, huh? no. anywho the world is your oyster, if you have to read reviews about the company from ex employees then its nit for you.

Horrible Management
Human Resources Team Member (Former Employee) –  Matteson, IL – July 3, 2016
I was an HR team member. They were falsifying documents, the ETL's never worked, they just sat on their butts and ate all day (which is why most of them are fat!). They only gave positive feedback to each other and TL's, never to Team members unless we were having a store visit. They are better at complaining and faking results for corporate than actually doing their job.
Pros
Pay
Cons
Management is lower than poor.

Bad management and hours.
HUMAN RESORUCES TEAM MEMBER (Current Employee) –  Savannah, GA – March 23, 2015
Communication from management is very bad and fake. Advancement is almost not possible. Always cutting hours. Typical day was very stressful and you never knew when you were going to be coached. The harder you work the worst they were on you.
Pros
Other team members were very nice.
Cons
Everything
