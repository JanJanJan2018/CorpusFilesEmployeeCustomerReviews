Competive
Massage Therapist (Former Employee) –  Newport Beach, CA – July 16, 2018
A typical day at work is pick up client take to room, do massage, clean room, get next client. On your break you had to start laundry, fold laundry, and put in cupboards. Completely clean rooms once a month including cupboards. Every morning vacuum, every evening take out the trash. We barely had any rest time. Some massage therapists did not monitor there time and ran over which made you late. It could be frustrating.
Pros
Nice area, beautiful scenery
Cons
Low pay, no pay for wait time, no pay for doing laundry or cleaning the office

Ok for a stepping stone job
Lifestyle Consultant (Former Employee) –  Houston, TX – July 12, 2018
The managers where very friendly and very approachable. Most of the staff was nice and it had a very nice family vibe. Unfortunately, I was let go with no warning or sign. In the short time I was there 4 people where let go. After only a week and a half 2 new people where hired and I was responsible for training them while still new myself. They slacked often and didn't get any reprimand. was let go with no warning from my position. In the short time I was there 4 people where let go. After only a few weeks 2 new people where hired and I was responsible for training them while still new myself. There where many time where questions that I didn't know the answer too and there was no manager on site either. The managers had schedules that left the premises without a manager for most of the day multiple times a week.

In all honesty, I had no problem with the job (besides how commission driven it was) until the new people where hired.
Pros
Great people overall
Cons
EXTREMELY commission driven, often left with no leadership
Fair

After I had my daughter Massage Heights was not for me. Moved on to Massage Envy. I did enjoy my time there while it lasted. The owner went through some medical issues that effected my position.

Nice place to work
Assistant Retreat Director (Former Employee) –  Atlanta, GA – February 15, 2018

Pros
Free Massage Practicals
Cons
Clientele had bad attitudes
Fun to work for

Good Place To Start
Massage Therapist/Lead Therapist (Current Employee) –  Houston, TX – February 3, 2018
This was my first job as a therapist out of school and would definitely say working for a chain in the industry is a great way to start but should NOT be your end goal if you intend to truly grow as a therapist. Loved and thankful for the opportunity but not where a forward thinking therapist should stay for long.
Pros
Team oriented, fast paced
Cons
Over worked, Underappreciated
Fun, but Difficult
Lifestyle Consultant (Current Employee) –  Atlanta, GA – January 20, 2018
This job is a fast-paced work environment. You get busy, especially around the holidays. Management is excellent, but you could be a shining star and still not get a raise or promotion unless you twisted someone's leg. I don't know what's going on upstairs, but they need to get their money together because if it weren't for the commission for which I had to SWEAT, I would be getting paid less than department store employees.
Pros
Commission+Hourly, Minimal physical labor, great environment
Cons
Slightly competitive, rare raises, they don't promote from within often.
Bad Location Good company
Lifestyle Consultant (Current Employee) –  Hixson, TN – December 12, 2017
The company worked well with its employess and private business owners, but my personal boss and location were not very good with the business and ended up closing suddenly
